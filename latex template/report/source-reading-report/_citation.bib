   Abstract = {This paper discusses a multi-issue bargaining game in which the players set up an agenda and negotiate on the issues sequentially according to this agenda. We demonstrate that the agenda might play an important role in the bargaining and discuss the relationship between the agenda and the final outcome of the bargaining game. Assuming that players have conflicting evaluations regarding the importance of the issues under negotiation, we identify the type of agenda each player prefers. We also show that in such cases the outcome of the bargaining game need not to be efficient. By demonstrating the strategic use of the agenda the paper explains the phenomenon of \},

   Abstract = {The present study examined lying behaviour in children between 3 and 7 years of age with two experiments. A temptation resistance paradigm was used in which children were left alone in a room with a music-playing toy placed behind their back. The children were told not to peek at the toy. Most children could not resist the temptation and peeked at the toy. When the experimenter asked them whether they had peeked, about half of the 3-year-olds confessed to their transgression, whereas most older children lied. Naive adult evaluators (undergraduate students and parents) who watched video clips of the children's responses could not discriminate lie-tellers from nonliars on the basis of their nonverbal expressive behaviours. However, the children were poor at semantic leakage control and adults could correctly identify most of the lie-tellers based on their verbal statements made in the same context as the lie. The combined results regarding children's verbal and nonverbal leakage control suggest that children under 8 years of age are not fully skilled lie-tellers.},

   Abstract = {We present a model of negotiation for virtual agents that extends previous work to be more human-like and applicable to a broader range of situations, including more than two negotiators with different goals, and negotiating over multiple options. The agents can dynamically change their negotiating strategies based on the current values of several parameters and factors that can be updated in the course of the negotiation. We have implemented this model and done preliminary evaluation within a prototype training system and a three-party negotiation with two virtual humans and one human.},
