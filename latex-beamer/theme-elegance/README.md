Beamer theme for LuaLaTex based on HSRM with some nice configuration options.

# Theme examples

These screenshots are a demonstration of
what this theme might look like with different backgrounds.

The backgrounds are easily created from the demo files
by using some tool that can edit PDFs like Inkscape.
